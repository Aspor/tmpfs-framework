	abstract = {Cognitive automobiles consist of a set of algorithms that cover a wide range of processing levels: from low-level image acquisition and feature extraction up to situation assessment and decision making. The modules implementing them are naturally characterized by decreasing data rates at higher levels, because raw data is discarded after evaluation, and increasing processing intervals, as knowledge based levels require longer computation times. The architecture presented in this papers offers a method to interchange information with different temporal resolutions liberally among modules with distinct cycle times and realtime demands. It allows effortless buffering of raw data for subsequent data fusion and verification, facilitating innovative processing structures. The paper is completed by measurements demonstrating the achieved real-time capabilities on our selected hardware architecture.},

	doi = {10.1109/CASE49439.2021.9551447},
	abstract = {Modern robots are mainly controlled by monolithic black-box controllers provided by the individual manufacturers. In research institutions the first version of the Robot Operating System (ROS1) is widely used for different applications. However, ROS1 lacks real-time capable communication. The ongoing development of ROS2 promises to break this paradigm. By employing Data Distribution Service (DDS) as a middleware the modular architecture aims at providing realtime capabilities. This study assesses the current prospects and limitations of ROS2. It gains novel insights towards improved and, in particular, reliable results regarding latencies and jitter. To this end, the allocation and transmission of ROS2 messages is evaluated in an example application for robotic control. An oscilloscope is applied for external validation of the measurements in such a time-synchronized distributed network. The complete application is set up from non-real-time object detection towards real-time control via ROS2 and EtherCAT. An in-depth evaluation of the ROS2 communication stack on a single host and in distributed setups is included. With real-time safe memory allocation and highly privileged ROS2 processes real-time capabilities are ensured.},

The goal of YARP is to minimize the effort devoted to infrastructure-level software development by facilitating code reuse, modularity and so maximize research-level development and collaboration. Humanoid robotics is a “bleeding edge” field of research, with constant flux in sensors, actuators, and processors. Code reuse and maintenance is therefore a significant challenge. We describe the main problems we faced and the solutions we adopted. In short, the main features of YARP include support for inter-process communication, image processing as well as a class hierarchy to ease code reuse across different hardware platforms. YARP is currently used and tested on Windows, Linux and QNX6 which are common operating systems used in robotics.},

	abstract = {This paper presents HyperGraph ROS, an open-source robot operating system that unifies intra-process, inter-process, and cross-device computation into a computational hypergraph for efficient message passing and parallel execution. In order to optimize communication, HyperGraph ROS dynamically selects the optimal communication mechanism while maintaining a consistent API. For intra-process messages, Intel-TBB Flow Graph is used with C++ pointer passing, which ensures zero memory copying and instant delivery. Meanwhile, inter-process and cross-device communication seamlessly switch to ZeroMQ. When a node receives a message from any source, it is immediately activated and scheduled for parallel execution by Intel-TBB. The computational hypergraph consists of nodes represented by TBB flow graph nodes and edges formed by TBB pointer-based connections for intra-process communication, as well as ZeroMQ links for inter-process and cross-device communication. This structure enables seamless distributed parallelism. Additionally, HyperGraph ROS provides ROS-like utilities such as a parameter server, a coordinate transformation tree, and visualization tools. Evaluation in diverse robotic scenarios demonstrates significantly higher transmission and throughput efficiency compared to ROS 2.

The fast read and write capabilities of random access memory and file system features are leveraged to implement a simple communication protocol between processes running on the same machine. Shareable data is saved in the tmpfs with descriptive names using the well-defined Concise Binary Object Representation ({CBOR}) format, making it easy to discover and decode available information. Atomic writes can be ensured using Portable Operating System Interface ({POSIX}) compliant rename. Using operating system features makes the system easy to implement. Example hardware and use-cases are presented, demonstrating the system’s viability. The presented use-cases show that the system can be used for interfacing sensors to be used in data collection system. Future work will include improving performance and expanding use to a robotics middleware.},
